*Aside for learners:*

-------

*It's a good idea to do as much of this assignment as you can before looking at the template -- that way you are building your own Python muscles, and only getting the smallest amount of help as possible.*

*Below, you'll find what an example README could look like.  It's just an idea, so feel free to make your own choices that are different than what's shown here.*

*You'll also see links to files within this folder -- things like pseudocode (optional for you to do), code, and data.  We suggest that if you're stuck in an assignment, you do the following:*

* *Re-read the assignment description in Canvas*
* *Try writing out some pseudocode (logical steps that are small and break down the task, but don't use actual code)*
* *Take a look at the corresponding README in this repository to see if that is enough to help you get un-stuck*
* *Look at the [pseudocode](#pseudocode), to see just the logic, without the code*
* *Only if absolutely necessary: look at the [code sample](Assignment_11.ipynb)*
* *Problems with GitHub rendering the code sample?  Use the [quick workaround described in this repo's README](../README.md#problems-in-github)
* *Make use of resources like Stack Overflow, to practice how to get help when you're not in a class situation*
* *Still stuck?  Ask for help in Canvas!*

## Pseudocode

Here are the steps we're doing in this module, according to the description for the Module 11 Muscle Builder:

* Ingest a portion of your data into a pandas data frame.
* Using plotly and/or bokeh, make two data visualizations, at least one of which is interactive or animated.  "Interactive" means that the viewer can change the data visualization by doing something like changing a widget value, zooming in, or clicking on a data point. "Animated" means that with or without user interaction, the data visualization moves and changes to represent some change across data (like change in time).
* Use well-structured, grammatically correct, and useful guidance for the consumer of your code, using markdown.  A literate statistical programming approach is always welcome!
* Ensure that your code is in a Module 11 folder of a public GitHub repository, and share the link with your instructor.
