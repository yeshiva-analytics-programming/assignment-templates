*Aside for learners:*

-------

*It's a good idea to do as much of this assignment as you can before looking at the template -- that way you are building your own Python muscles, and only getting the smallest amount of help as possible.*

*Below, you'll find what an example README could look like.  It's just an idea, so feel free to make your own choices that are different than what's shown here.*

*You'll also see links to files within this folder -- things like pseudocode (optional for you to do), code, and data.  We suggest that if you're stuck in an assignment, you do the following:*

* *Re-read the assignment description in Canvas*
* *Try writing out some pseudocode (logical steps that are small and break down the task, but don't use actual code)*
* *Take a look at the corresponding README in this repository to see if that is enough to help you get un-stuck*
* *Look at the [pseudocode](#pseudocode), to see just the logic, without the code*
* *Only if absolutely necessary: look at the [code sample](Assignment_12.ipynb)*
* *Problems with GitHub rendering the code sample?  Use the [quick workaround described in this repo's README](../README.md#problems-in-github)
* *Make use of resources like Stack Overflow, to practice how to get help when you're not in a class situation*
* *Still stuck?  Ask for help in Canvas!*

## Pseudocode

Here are the steps we're doing in this module, according to the description for the Module 12 Muscle Builder:

* Ingest some or all of your final project data into a pandas data frame
* Do any data cleaning or combining you need to do to make your data tidier, more accurate, or more useful.
* Select some data on which you're going to perform a statistical test, and explain why you're choosing that particular data and why the test you're choosing makes sense.  You might want to do a correlation, a two-sample t test, a chi-square test, an ANOVA, or another statistical test.
* Interpret the result of your test -- are you surprised?  Is there a statistically significant finding?
* Explain your statistical and data reasoning throughout your script using Markdown.
* Share your script in a Module 12 folder in a public GitHub repository, and give that link to your instructor.
