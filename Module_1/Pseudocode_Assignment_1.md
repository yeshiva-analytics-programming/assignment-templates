# Pseudocode for Assignment 1

Pseudocode is just a way of writing the logic of the code in my own words, without using code.

My assignment is pretty clear, but since assignments are going to get tougher, I want to get in the practice of writing pseudocode.

## Steps:

1. First, I will use `import` to import "antigravity", whatever that is.
2. Then, I have to do some math.  I will do this in two sub-steps:

  * Create a variable that contains a number
  * Do math on that variable (maybe just multiply it by 5, or something?)


3. Finally, I have to create a dictionary.  I'm not sure what a dictionary is, but I can look at the assignment template to get an idea.  I'll do this in a couple of steps:

  * Create an empty dictionary 
  * Add an entry to the dictionary
  * Keep adding entries until I have a handful (4? 5?) entries in my dictionary
  * Print my dictionary to show I created it successfully

## Markdown!

And throughout, I'll add Markdown to show what I'm doing along the way.  I'm supposed to pretend that I'm showing off my work to someone who's not very technical and needs to grasp what's happening when.
