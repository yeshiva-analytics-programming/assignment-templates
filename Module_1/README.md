# Module 1

In this Module, I've been asked to provide the following:

## Markdown Elements

* A Markdown header cell that contains a title, date, and your name
* Markdown cells that explain various steps of your python code in language that’s easy for a non-technical stakeholder to understand
* Bold and italic emphasis in appropriate locations
* At least one bulleted or numbered list

## Code Elements

* Optional, but fun:  try “import antigravity”.
* Create a numeric variable and demonstrate simple math on that variable
* Create a short dictionary that tells me something about yourself, e.g. your career goals, favorite sports teams, country you’re from.
