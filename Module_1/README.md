*Aside for learners:*

-------

*It's a good idea to do as much of this assignment as you can before looking at the template -- that way you are building your own Python muscles, and only getting the smallest amount of help as possible.*

*Below, you'll find what an example README could look like.  It's just an idea, so feel free to make your own choices that are different than what's shown here.*

*You'll also see links to files within this folder -- things like pseudocode (optional for you to do), code, and data.  We suggest that if you're stuck in an assignment, you do the following:*

* *Re-read the assignment description in Canvas*
* *Take a look at the corresponding README in this repository to see if that is enough to help you get un-stuck*
* *Look at the pseudocode, to see just the logic, without the code*
* *Only if absolutely necessary: look at the code sample*

# Module 1

## Problem Description

In this Module, I've been asked to provide the following:

### Markdown Elements

* A Markdown header cell that contains a title, date, and your name
* Markdown cells that explain various steps of your python code in language that’s easy for a non-technical stakeholder to understand
* Bold and italic emphasis in appropriate locations
* At least one bulleted or numbered list

### Code Elements

* Optional, but fun:  try “import antigravity”.
* Create a numeric variable and demonstrate simple math on that variable
* Create a short dictionary that tells me something about yourself, e.g. your career goals, favorite sports teams, country you’re from.

## Files

This folder contains two files:

* [Pseudocode for the assignment (optional)](Pseudocode_Assignment_1.md)
* [My code](Assignment_1.ipynb)
