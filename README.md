# Assignment Templates

Not all of the assignments for the Analytics Programming course will be able to be "templated" -- some rely on your using data that's part of your final assignment, and the choices you make in those files depend on what kind of data you have.

Still, it's helpful, as you're getting started, to know what a successful submission of an assignment might look like.  We hope these templates help you!

## How to Use These Templates

It's a good idea to do as much of this assignment as you can before looking at the template -- that way you are building your own Python muscles, and only getting the smallest amount of help as possible.

For each module, you'll see things like a sample README file, pseudocode (optional for you to do), code, and data.  We suggest that if you're stuck in an assignment, you do the following:*

* *Re-read the assignment description in Canvas*
* *Try writing out some pseudocode (logical steps that are small and break down the task, but don't use actual code)*
* *Take a look at the corresponding README in this repository to see if that is enough to help you get un-stuck*
* *Look at the [pseudocode](#pseudocode), to see just the logic, without the code*
* *Only if absolutely necessary: look at the [code sample](Assignment_5.ipynb)*
* *Make use of resources like Stack Overflow, to practice how to get help when you're not in a class situation*
* *Still stuck?  Ask for help in Canvas!*

## Problems in GitHub?

GitHub **usually** does a great job of rendering Jupyter notebooks (also known as iPython notebooks, their former name) so that they're easy to read and look just like what you'd see in your local computer, running a notebook.  But sometimes GitHub servers get overwhelmed.

If you get a message like "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing an .ipynb in GitHub (for example, these assignment templates), here is a quick workaround:

* Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
* Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/yeshiva-analytics-programming/assignment-templates/blob/master/Module_5/Assignment_5.ipynb") there
