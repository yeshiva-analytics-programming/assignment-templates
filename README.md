# Assignment Templates

Not all of the assignments for the Analytics Programming course will be able to be "templated" -- some rely on your using data that's part of your final assignment, and the choices you make in those files depend on what kind of data you have.

Still, it's helpful, as you're getting started, to know what a successful submission of an assignment might look like.  We hope these templates help you!
