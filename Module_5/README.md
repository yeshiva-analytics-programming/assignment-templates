*Aside for learners:*

-------

*It's a good idea to do as much of this assignment as you can before looking at the template -- that way you are building your own Python muscles, and only getting the smallest amount of help as possible.*

*Below, you'll find what an example README could look like.  It's just an idea, so feel free to make your own choices that are different than what's shown here.*

*You'll also see links to files within this folder -- things like pseudocode (optional for you to do), code, and data.  We suggest that if you're stuck in an assignment, you do the following:*

* *Re-read the assignment description in Canvas*
* *Take a look at the corresponding README in this repository to see if that is enough to help you get un-stuck*
* *Look at the pseudocode, to see just the logic, without the code*
* *Only if absolutely necessary: look at the code sample*

# Module 5

## Problem Description

In this Module, I've been asked to do the following:


Create a notebook that:

* Includes a DataFrame representing student performance, with at least 10 rows.  This DataFrame will contain several (fabricated) series of at least length 10 you create, namely:
  - Student id (5-digit number, randomly assigned using numpy) -- this is your DataFrame index, or row name
  - Student first names
  - Student last names
  - Last term’s math grades (70-100, randomly assigned using numpy)
  - This term’s math grades (70-100, randomly assigned using numpy)
  - Last term’s language grades (70-100, randomly assigned using numpy)
  - This term’s language grades (70-100, randomly assigned using numpy)
* Includes series and dataframe operations to determine:
  - Highest and lowest math grade (across both terms)
  - Overall (mean) change in math grades from last term to this term (take the mean of each student’s improvement)
  - Highest and lowest language grade (across both terms)
  - Overall (mean) change in language grades from last term to this term  (take the mean of each student’s improvement)
  - Uses .loc to find a specific grade for a specific student ID number
  - Uses .iloc to find a specific data value by integer location (e.g. 4th entry in the 3rd column)
  - Sorts and prints the data using student last name

As always, I'm instructed to use markdown cells throughout this assignment in order explain to a naive stakeholder what I'm doing along the way.
