            "he also managed to cast this era's greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle . \n",
            "for about 160 out of its 170 minutes , \" saving private ryan \" is flawless . \n",
            "literally . \n",
            "the plot is simple enough . \n",

            "once they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home . \n",

            "spielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection . \n",
            "the sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan . \n",
