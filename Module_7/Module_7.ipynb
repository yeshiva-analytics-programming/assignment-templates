    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the city of New York, citizens with non-emergency complaints (e.g. trash non-collection, rodent infestations) can call 311 to make a Service Request.  These are recorded and shared on New York's open data site at  https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data dates from 2010 to the current day, with data being updated on a daily basis.  At the time of this writing, there are over 20 million rows, each row representing a single service request, and over 40 columns which represent aspects of each service request, such as the street address being referenced, the type of complaint, the agency responsible, the date of the service request, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll use `pandas` to bring in the (somewhat incomplete) data dictionary supplied by the City."

I suspect this has to do with batches of complaints being formally closed for a given borough when work crews concentrate in a specific area.  So, in a couple of days, a lot of open tickets get closed out all at once in one borough (giving us a stripe of that borough's color), and then the complaints build up there for awhile before all getting resolved later in another few day work sprint.  Meanwhile, complaints come in fairly evenly, across all days. \n",
