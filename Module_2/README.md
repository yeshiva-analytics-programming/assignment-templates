# Module 2

Here I, a candidate for the Data Analytics MS at Yeshiva University, was asked to do the following, in partial completion of the requirements of my Python class:

* Create a README.md (this file!)
* Create a [Jupyter Notebook](Assignment_2.ipynb)

In the [Jupyter Notebook](Assignment_2.ipynb), I'm going to do the following:

* Create a list of all lower case letters and a separate list of the numbers 1-26.
* Use a for loop to print out which numbers in my list are divisible by 4
* Print both lists and show their types.
* Using zip, create a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of the lower case letter and its numerical equivalent, 1-26.
* Print the list of tuples, the type of the list, and the type of the first element in that list.
* Using list comprehension, create a list of letters for which have ordinal values (1-26) that are multiples of 4.
