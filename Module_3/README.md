# Module 3

Here I, a candidate for the Data Analytics MS at Yeshiva University, was asked to do the following, in partial completion of the requirements of my Python class:

* Create a README.md (this file!)
* Create a [Jupyter Notebook](Assignment_2.ipynb)

In the [Jupyter Notebook](Assignment_2.ipynb), I'm going to do the following:

* Reproduce all the things that I did in the [last module](../Module_2)

* Do some exciting new stuff:
  - Using a loop, show the unicode value for each letter, using ord().
  - For each lowercase letter of the alphabet, come up with a unique integer that is some calculated combination of the unicode value and/or the ordinal position (1-26) of the letter in the alphabet.
  - Make sure the code for each letter is unique, so that no code number repeats for more than one letter!  
  - Create a dictionary that gives, for each letter of the alphabet, the code value you created.
  - Create an encoding function that takes a string of lower case letters and returns a list of integers representing a the code number given to each letter.  
  - Make sure the function will exit with a helpful message if there is an element in the string that isn’t encodable (isn’t a lowercase letter).
  - Try out the function using the word "hello".
  - Try out the function using the string "hello there".
