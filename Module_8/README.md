*Aside for learners:*

-------

*It's a good idea to do as much of this assignment as you can before looking at the template -- that way you are building your own Python muscles, and only getting the smallest amount of help as possible.*

*Below, you'll find what an example README could look like.  It's just an idea, so feel free to make your own choices that are different than what's shown here.*

*You'll also see links to files within this folder -- things like pseudocode (optional for you to do), code, and data.  We suggest that if you're stuck in an assignment, you do the following:*

* *Re-read the assignment description in Canvas*
* *Try writing out some pseudocode (logical steps that are small and break down the task, but don't use actual code)*
* *Take a look at the corresponding README in this repository to see if that is enough to help you get un-stuck*
* *Look at the [pseudocode](#pseudocode), to see just the logic, without the code*
* *Only if absolutely necessary: look at the [code sample](Assignment_8.ipynb)*
* *Problems with GitHub rendering the code sample?  Use the [quick workaround described in this repo's README](../README.md#problems-in-github)
* *Make use of resources like Stack Overflow, to practice how to get help when you're not in a class situation*
* *Still stuck?  Ask for help in Canvas!*

## Pseudocode

There's not really any pseudocode here, as each person's pseudocode will differ, based on the data they analyze.  Generally speaking,
here are the steps we're doing in this module, according to the description for the Module 8 Muscle Builder:

* Use pandas to ingest some data from your final project dataset 
* Then perform 3 or more data cleaning techniques
* And describe everything using a literate statistical programming paradigm
